# React-Express App

This project is a simple full-stack application using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. It demonstrates a basic setup where the frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful API calls.

## Features

- **React**: A frontend library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications.
- **Environment Variables**: Use of dotenv for managing environment settings.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for both frontend and backend.
- **Logging**: Using morgan to log HTTP requests.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for documenting the API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB integration for data persistence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barl-community/react-express-app.git
cd react-express-app
```

### Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### Frontend

Navigate to the `client` directory, install dependencies, and start the frontend server:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
The React application will open up in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.


### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and one inside the `client` directory with the necessary environment variables:

- Root `.env`:

```plaintext
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

- Client `.env`:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
